# **MindBreak**

## **An enhanced version of MindFuck**



### **Why?**

&nbsp;	Because I can.

&nbsp;	So, it's pretty much the same as MindFuck but it has ques from assembly.

&nbsp;	I recomend learning BrainFuck before using this.



### **How to use:**

&nbsp;	***\* any operator marked with a star (\*) was either added or modifyed from source material***



#### **The Tape:**

&nbsp;	You have a read/write head on a tape of 1000 descrete cells.

&nbsp;	Each cell is an interger.

&nbsp;	A cell can only be worked with if the tapehead has selected it.





#### **Basic Operators:**

&nbsp;	***(>)*** - Moves the tapehead one (1) position to the right,

&nbsp;	***(<)*** - Moves the tapehead one (1) position to the left,

&nbsp;	***(+)*** - Increments the value of the current cell selected by the tapehead by one (1),

Â 	***(-)*** - Increments the value of the current cell selected by the tapehead by negative-one (-1),

&nbsp;	***(#)\**** - A No-Op, can be used more than one with Numbers,



#### **In-Out:**

&nbsp;	***(.)*** - Outputs the currently selected cell as an [ASCII Character](https:/ascii-code.com/ASCII),

&nbsp;	***(,)*** - Takes input one-cell-at-a-time as an ASCII value, and not a character, no input defualts to a zero (0),



#### **Numbers:**

&nbsp;	The Numbers system is denoted as any base-ten numbers between zero and nine (0-9).

&nbsp;	The Numbers repeat the last Basic Operator X times, where X is the number.

&nbsp;	**NOTE:** The numbers are used one-at-a-time, 15 is (1+5=6), not the number 15.



#### **Skip-if-Zero:**

&nbsp;	***(\[ ])\**** - Skip-if-Zero operator. Instead of the loop operator of regular BrainFuck,

&nbsp;		 It just skips the code inside if the current cell's value is 0.

&nbsp;		 Hovever, these cannot be nested. this is by design.



#### **Pointers:**

&nbsp;	Now we get to the most advance part of the language. This is a powerful but unpredictable feature, use it wisely.

&nbsp;	***($)\**** - Type **T** pointer declaration. It records the value in the current cell as a *Tape Index*, which can be jumped to from

&nbsp;	       Anywhere else.

&nbsp;	***(\&)\**** - Program Pointer, **p** type. It records the current value in the selected cell as a *Code Index*,

&nbsp;	       A code index is an index that records a the spot of a particular character (Operator) within your code.

&nbsp;	       You can jump back to that point from anywhere else.

&nbsp;	***(\*)\**** - Jump-To-Pointer operator. It uses the value in the current cell as the index to jump to any defined operator.

&nbsp;	      **It takes into account the pointer type by itself**.

&nbsp;	      The index of the pointers is a zero-indexed array where a new pointer is added to the bottom of the stack

&nbsp;	      in order of definition.
